      Backblaze

      Create a JSON file named B2.credentials in your home directory with
      the application key and the account key:

          { "accountId":      "...",
            "applicationKey": ".............."
          }

 $b2->create_bucket

      $b2->create_bucket(
          bucketName => 'my_files',
          bucketType => 'allPrivate',
      );

    Bucket names can consist of: letters, digits, "-", and "_".

    https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/b2_create_bucket.html

    The bucketName has to be globally unique, so expect this request to
    fail, a lot.

          bucketId => ...,
      );

    Bucket names can consist of: letters, digits, "-", and "_".

    The bucket must be empty of all versions of all files.
